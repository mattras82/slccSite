                <p>People have been making their own beer since the beginning of
                recorded history, and now you can too! The idea behind beer, or
                more specifically ale, is actually incredibly simple: You make 
                food for the yeast, the yeast eat the food, and the end result is
                a delicious beverage cherished worldwide.  Now, the actual process
                is a lot more involved, so let's get started!  Click on the tabs
                below to learn more about the different steps of making beer.</p>

                            <h4>Before You Brew</h4>
                            <p>There's a lot of things to take into consideration
                            before you start brewing beer. How many gallons are 
                            you going to make?  Which method will you use?  Do 
                            you have the right equipment to complete that method?
                            Do you have a great recipe?  Most beginners in the 
                            homebrewing world like to start off simple (and cheap)
                            so they don't bite off more than they can chew.  The
                            great thing about homebrewing is that there is always
                            room to grow as a brewer.  However, starting small is
                            never about thing.  The absolute essential equipment you'll need
                            are: a kettle, a siphon, heavy-duty cleaner, Low-pH
                            sanitizer, a fermentation vessel, some tubing, a 
                            thermometer, a hydrometer, and some food-safe tubing.
                            The actual size and type of those items will depend on
                            your batch sizes.  Feel free to ask your local homebrew
                            supply clerks for their input.  If you're not able to
                            make it to a local store, check out some great sites
                            like <a href='northerbrewer.com'>Northern Brewer</a>.</p>
                            <p>Now that you've got your equipment, you'll need a
                            recipe.  At Matt's Brew Site, it's easy to build your
                            own beer with tools like auto-complete for popular hops
                            and yeasts. Let's look at the 3 factors that go into
                            each beer recipe:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><h5>Grains</h5>
                                    <p>The grains are a very big part of every
                                    beer.  The sugars that live in the grains are
                                    the food that the yeast need to produce alcohol.
                                    Most grain bills are made up of a majority of
                                    base malt, usually American 2-Row or British
                                    Marris Otter.  Caramel/Crystal malts are very
                                    popular for their sweetening, darkening, & 
                                    foaming characteristics.  Chocolate malt is 
                                    used for dark ales, such as stouts and porters,
                                    for its almost-black color and chocolatey-sweet
                                    taste.  Other popular malts include Victory & 
                                    Munich, which are used in a wide variety of beers, 
                                    from hoppy India Pale Ales to easy-drinking
                                    Brown Ales.  Brewers also use ingredients that 
                                    aren't malted barley, called adjuncts.  Popular
                                     adjuncts include flaked wheat and flaked oats.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><h5>Hops</h5>
                                    <p>Hops are the 'spice' of every beer recipe.
                                    Because beer is made of sugary-sweet water, you'll
                                    want to balance that out with some bitter flowers
                                    called hops.  Hops are used throughout the brewing
                                     process from mash-hopping to dry-hopping.  
                                    Brewers pick their hops based on the bittering 
                                    and aromatic capabilities.  An easy way to 
                                    measure the strength of hops is their Alpha 
                                    Acid levels, or AA%.  The more alpha acids a hop
                                    strain has, the more bitter it will make your beer.
                                      Popular hops include US Cascade and UK Willamette.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><h5>Yeast</h5>
                                    <p>Some brewers will say that the yeast is 
                                    the most important part of every beer. 
                                    "Happy yeast, happy ale!"  The biggest factors
                                     of a good fermentation are having enough yeast 
                                    to eat all of the sugars and keeping everything 
                                    at the proper temperature.  Each yeast strain 
                                    will have different characteristics that will 
                                    be imparted on your beer throughout the 
                                    fermentation.  Yeast characteristics include 
                                    the ester profile, phenolic profile, attenuation 
                                    level, flocculation rates, and temperature range.

                                    the right kind of yeast for your beer.</p>

                            <h4>Mashing the Grains</h4>
                            <p>The mash step is the first step of the brew day.  
                            After you fill your kettle with your mash water and 
                            get that heated to the correct mashing temperature 
                            (usually 150&deg;F-156&deg;F) you either put your 
                            grains inside a mesh bag and drop that into the water,
                             or put the grains in a cooler (called a mash tun) and
                             dump the hot water on top of the grains.  Now that the
                             mash liquid is mixed with the grain, you have entered 
                            the saccharification step.  During this hour-long step
                             the maltose sugars in the grain are being extracted 
                            into the liquid, pulling the color and taste of the 
                            different malts with them.  Depending on your mashing 
                            method, you'll also go through a vorlauf step, sparge step, and/or 
                            a mash-out step.  These are optional and we'll ignore
                             those for now. Onto the next step!</p>

                        <section>
                            <h4>Boiling the Wort</h4>
                            <p>Now that you've completed the mash step, you'll 
                            seperate the grains from the sugary liquid, called the 
                            wort, and get the wort into your boil kettle.  The boil 
                            serves many purposes for the brew day.  It's used to 
                            sanitize the wort and is the main point of hop additions,
                             as well as a few other purposes.  Almost every recipe 
                             you'll find will have hop additions at '60 minutes'.
                              This means that you'll need to add that certain hop 
                            charge with 60 minutes left in the boil.  Most ale boils
                             are 60 minutes long, with a lot of lager boils taking 
                            up to 90 minutes.  Hop additions with >30 minutes left 
                            in the boil are mainly for used to bitter up the taste 
                            of the beer, while additions closer to the end of the 
                            boil are used to get a hoppy aroma.  Once the boil timer 
                            has gone off, you're ready to cut the heat and chill
                             the wort in preparation for the next step!</p>

                            <h4>Waiting for Beer</h4>
                            <p>Up to this point you've gathered your equipment, 
                            put together a recipe, mashed the grains, and boiled the 
                            wort.  Now you're ready to turn that hoppy, sugary 
                            wort into beer.  Well, you're ready to pitch the yeast 
                            and let them do all of the work.  All you have to do 
                            is put in enough yeast and make sure the temperature 
                            is in the right range during fermentation.  Keep in 
                            mind that after the wort has gone through the boil step,
                             everything that comes into contact with the beer must 
                            be sanitary.  You've created a paradise for microbes 
                            that can ruin your beer if you're not careful.  Use 
                            the sanitized siphon and tubing to transfer your cooled 
                            wort into your cleaned and sanitized fermenter.  The 
                            yeast also need plenty of oxygen to fuel their fermentation,
                            so you'll want to vigorously shake the filled fermentor 
                            for about a minute.  Now it's time to put in the yeast.
                              Make sure you follow the directions on the package!
                              Different yeasts call for different parameters for 
                            pitching and fermentation.  Now that the yeast is in, 
                            you're ready to wait!  Store the fermentor in a cool,
                             dark place for the next 2-4 weeks.  Make sure to keep 
                            the beer away from any sunlight or UV rays, as the acids 
                            extracted from the hops will have a very unpleasant 
                            reaction.  Beer fermentation is a beautiful thing to 
                            watch, but try to not disturb the beer too much while 
                            you wait.  After a few weeks, you're ready to bottle/keg 
                            the beer and enjoy!</p>
